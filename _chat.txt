[14/03/19, 12:17:40 PM] Hardik Kataria: I am a student from the Vellore Institute of Technology, India. It has been very difficult for my parents to pay even the fees for my college, they have taken educational loans for my education. I have two more siblings who are studying, and my parents have to pay the fees for that as well and it has been very difficult to afford education for all of them. 

I am very keen on learning this course. I have been inclined to this course for a long time now.  My college doesn’t offer this course in detail and I would really like to learn this course and be the future in this field. I would be very grateful if I could learn this course under your guidance and your financial support. I agree to complete this course with full dedication and make the most use of this course. I would further learn more courses related to this and want to get into the field of Cyber Security and Software Security and its applications as I see great scope in this field in the future. I am currently pursuing Computer Science in my college and having in-depth knowledge of Software Security would help me in a lot of places.
[14/03/19, 12:18:19 PM] Angad Sharma: I have a thirst for knowledge., but to get the best resources we need to pay. I was really excited when i got to know about the financial aid program. 

I come from a low-income background and cannot afford to pay hefty amounts for education.Moreover, my parents do not encourage me to spend online on courses. Despite all of that i want to learn a lot of things and this is the best platform for me to do so. Even my mother has to work as a teacher in a small school while my father works electricity, just to support our small family. They would be overjoyed if they know that im learning something without eroding away they hard earned and scarce money

Financial aid solves a huge problem for me as i will be able to study for a better future and someday repay the debts that i have to this organization in both money and services
[14/03/19, 12:19:01 PM] Sarthak Dhawan: I can't apply for the course normally because most of my saved money has been gone in my college fees and now i don't stand any chance to pay even a normal fees and i feel this course is perfect for the type of education for what i am looking .! also i am already studying on a student loan for the half of my money in my college fees and i don't know how will i be able to pay that back..!

i have also been doing some additional jobs to support my family in paying my fees.

we don't have proper electricity all the time in our house also i have worked very hard to get into a good college and now i want to study the best of the courses available and thus i feel that this will be the best option so that i can apply and start making some good projects and also.!






i have a big project in my mind and also i feel that this course is the perfect for the start to my career .!

and as i am a computer science student i feel this course will help me a lot i can also teach a few other people so that i can generate some money and also i can pay my college fees for the next time properly.

I can also get some good job offers from the next time and then I can also support my family because all the money that my father earns are totally spent in my college fees and thus we are unable to pay anymore fees for any other facilities so I want to support them financially and also I can support my siblings .!

I really feel this course is perfect for me and I will be able to get a proper line after this.



As i don't know when i will be able to return my student loan, then how could i afford a new loan. so, please help me in this.
