As mentioned earlier we will be getting 3k sponsorship from Optica. Instructions were very clear that you have to pm 10 names who are giving reviews. Inspire of giving clear instructions only 7 people have texted us the names yet we have double acknowledgements.

Either you all are taking it lightly or we are at fault at giving instructions. Kindly understand this is being done so that we can track names.

*Send the names to @918080328374  by tomorrow and complete the target.*

Get a glimpse into one of the most important applications, i.e., Machine Learning, as Codechef-VIT's own core committee member, Shubham Gupta, treads onto one of the trickiest and wittiest topic.
Join the Webinar on 'Introduction to Machine Learning', this Wednesday, the 31st of July, on our Facebook page, and keep the light of knowledge burning.

GraVITas team has orientation for *SCOPE* school Freshers on 7th August 6-8 pm, same time our event is going to be.

*So for now don't publicize the GraVITas orientation poster through your WhatsApp status or instagram, only share their post on FB, instead share about INSIGHT as much as you can.*

No need to worry, we still have a chance if publicity is done right, we can still pull the crowd from *SITE and CSE with Spec* and everyone can tell 10 of their friends to attend the event in case of emergency. *Write those 10 names here on the group*

*Keep your heads high, we can still do it... All the best.* ✌🏻✌🏻

Hello all..! 

Only a week Desk duties are left before CAT1. Few things which we have noticed and can be improved will be:

• Videos and posters were not on display at all times. If 2 laptops are there this can be done.
• Dribble links which were posted on group were not being used for pitching
• You have to be a bit more active on your desks and not just be sitting.
